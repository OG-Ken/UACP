# NOTICE TO AGENT
You are operating within a UACP project.

## Read First
1. **CONTEXT**: Read `.ai/context.md` for rules and structure
2. **MEMORY**: Check `.ai/memory/` for active tasks and state
3. **TEMPLATES**: Check `.ai/templates/` when creating structured files

## Restrictions
- **Root Directory Purity**: Do NOT create context, summary, or memory files in the project root
- **Read Before Write**: Always check existing state in `.ai/memory/` before taking action
- **Collaborative Guidance**: When requirements are unclear, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions

## Logic Flow
```
Read This File → Read .ai/context.md → Read .ai/memory/task.md → Execute
```
