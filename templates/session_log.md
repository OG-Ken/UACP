# Session Log Template

Use this format when creating log entries in `.ai/memory/`:

## Session: YYYY-MM-DD

### Changes Made
- Brief description of changes
- Another change

### Decisions
- Key decision: rationale
- Another decision: rationale

### Context for Next Session
- Important information to remember
- Known issues or blockers

---

## Guidelines
1. **Filename**: Use descriptive names like `session_YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `feature_name_log.md`
2. **Timestamp**: Include date and optionally time for each entry
3. **Brevity**: Focus on WHY things changed, not exhaustive WHAT
4. **Purpose**: Help future agents (or yourself) understand context quickly
5. **Decisions**: Record architectural decisions and their reasoning
